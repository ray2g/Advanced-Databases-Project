In a review of the album, AllMusic Guide wrote:  'This album has far more impact than you might expect from the score to a movie ? there's a sense of the music here working something out in Clapton's heart, a sense given a lot of power thanks to the intense, heart-wrenching passion invoked by some of the turns taken here. At its best, Clapton's music can speak of the pain he feels ? and Clapton has rarely been better than he is here. '",

The CD and DVD were originally released separately, but since have been released together as a combo. There are 25 songs in the CD and 39 in the DVD. While it was produced and released by Walt Disney Records, the band was reportedly given complete creative control over the project, which at the time was very unusual for Walt Disney Records, which had until then followed a strict artist control policy. As a result, the DVD features a variety of puppetry, animation and live action supplied by personal friends of the group, including AJ Schnack, who directed the TMBG documentary Gigantic (A Tale of Two Johns). For guest vocals on a few tracks, they turned to family: John Flansburgh's wife Robin Goldwasser, and John Linnell's son, Henry. The music videos that appear on the DVD were also aired (in part or whole) on the Disney Channel's children's programming block, Playhouse Disney. Here Come the ABCs was a great success for They Might Be Giants, the video being certified Gold (sales over 50,000) in 2005. The album reached #1 on Billboard?s Children?s Music charts, won Parenting Magazine?s Children?s DVD of the Year Award and two National Parenting Publications Awards (NAAPA). In addition, Amazon.com called it  'the best Children's Music album of 2005 ' and the 13th best overall album of 2005. Two follow-ups were released, Here Come the 123s in 2008 and Here Comes Science in 2009. Although the audio-only release is considered to be They Might Be Giants' 11th studio album, some of the songs make little sense without their visual accompaniment.",

            " 'That Smell ' is a song by the southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd. Written by Ronnie Van Zant and guitarist Allen Collins, it was released in 1977 on the album Street Survivors. At the time the song was written, the band had been drinking and doing many different drugs. Van Zant had said that he started drinking heavily to relieve the pressure of performing in front of large audiences. Van Zant's inspiration for the song was the increasing reckless indulgences of the band members culminating in the evening when guitarist Gary Rossington got drunk and high and survived the crash of his new car into an oak tree along Mandarin Road in Jacksonville, Florida (where the band was founded). Van Zant was thus inspired to write the song as a warning about the consequences of careless overuse of drugs and alcohol. Van Zant said,  'I had a creepy feeling things were going against us, so I thought I'd write a morbid song (as a warning). ' The lyrics cautioned that  'tomorrow might not be here for you ', and that  'the smell of death surrounds you '. Three days after the album was released, the band was devastated by a plane crash killing several members including Van Zant. The song is featured in the films Blow (2001), Joe Dirt (2001) and Wild Hogs (2007), at the end of the fourth episode of the HBO television drama series True Blood (2008). The song appeared in the first season of Entourage and the song also appeared in the twenty-first episode of the second season of Miami Vice (1984).",

Enema of the State was an enormous commercial success. The album sold over 15 million copies worldwide, catapulting the band to become one of the biggest rock bands of the turn of the century.  'What's My Age Again? ',  'All the Small Things ' and  'Adam's Song ' became hit singles and MTV staples, generating heavy radio airplay.
