For this query we will have to shells reading and updating the same album id, which will cause a dirty read, since the shell 2
is reading an old value and not waiting for the update on shell 1 to end resulting on only one album id getting the sales updated.

/*
To solve this problem we started by adding explicit locks which control 
concurrent access to data in tables. Usually the MVCC takes care of this issues 
however sometimes its required to add explicit locks to obtain the desired result. 
In the following query we added a line where we locked the table albums, 
this means no other transactions can neither read, write, delete or make updates in 
this table while the first transaction does not end.

While the first transaction is not finished the second one is on standby and when the first completes, the second starts and can prooceed the transaction where it will get the most recent values. In figure x and y its possible to check that the dirty read is solver and 2 rows were updated ( band_id 464 and album_id 1280 & 1338).

/*
ISOLATION LEVEL Read committed
Taking in consideration the phenomena ocurred with the query 2 and the figure ( figura dos diferentes niveis de isolamento) 
we can see that the read uncommited is the best isolation level to use in our query since the other levels are more restrict, 
however in postgresql read uncommited has the same behaviour as read committed, so internally only read commited is implemented.
In the following figures is possible to see how the isolation level was implemented in our code and aswell the results.

/*
As you can see, the first and second shell ended with 1 changed rows meaning it was sucessfull, this happens because
read commited checks if theres other transactions ocurring at the same time for the same piece of data that is being updated
and after the first one is updated the second transaction checks if the result of the first transaction is still aplies 
to the data we are selecting, if it does apply then it would update the same piece of data, but in our case
the data gets updated to 0 and no longer satisfies the condtion of the highest sales, so the second transaction checks again
which part of the data satisfies the condition and performs the update.
